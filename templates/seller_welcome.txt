Subject: Welcome to AgriRoute — Next steps to get selling

Hi {seller_name},

Welcome — thanks for joining AgriRoute

Quick checklist to start selling:
1. Complete your profile (farm name, address, short bio).
2. Upload at least 3 clear photos of your produce and one photo of your farm.
3. Create your first listing (product name, price/kg, available qty, min qty).
4. Add bank details so you can receive payouts.

Verification: We’ll review your uploads within 48 hours. You’ll receive a "Verified" badge once approved.

Fees: We charge a low platform fee (3%) on sales and a small listing fee (£0.10). We keep fees low to support farmers.
